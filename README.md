# Loan-and-Investment-Calculator
My first serious project. I made it as a final project for my Java course in college.
I just decided to put it onto Github cus I feel like it could possibly help someone and I also want to start building a nice profile.
This is what I'd consider a beginner(or intermidate at most) project so please don't expect the most polished program or efficient code.
Porgram Description:
It is a window that has prompts for you to click either the "investment" or "loan" button.
When the investment button is clicked it will open a JOptionPane that will allow the use to input the amount of money they wish to invest, the rate of interest of the investment, and how long they wish to invest(in years). It will then pop up another window that will show the the value of the investment at each year invested.
The loan button will pop up a JOptionPane that will ask the user if they want to calculate a normal loan or a mortgage. It will then prompt for the amount they wish to borrow and for how many do they want the loan/mortgage period to be. The program will then calcualte the interest rate depending on the amount borrowed, the loan period and if it is a normal loan or mortgage. It will then show output what the user had entered as well as the interest rate, how much interest was accumalated, how much they will own at the end of the loan period and how much they should pay monthly(if they chose mortgage)
